            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>COme harken to me all around,</l>
            <l>and I will tell you a merry tale:</l>
            <l>Of a Northumberland man, that held ſome ground,</l>
            <l>which was the Kings land in a dale;</l>
            <l>He was borne and bred thereupon,</l>
            <l>and his Father had dwelt there long before:</l>
            <l>Who kept a good houſe in that Country,</l>
            <l>and ſtav'd the Wolfe from off his doore.</l>
            <l>Now for this Farme the good old man,</l>
            <l>iuſt twenty ſhillings, a yeare did pay.</l>
            <l>At length came cruell death with his dart,</l>
            <l>and this old Farmer he ſoone did ſlay:</l>
            <l>Who left behind him an aude wife then,</l>
            <l>that troubled was with micle paine;</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:20591:4"/>And with her Crutches ſhe walkt about,</l>
            <l>for ſhe was likewiſe blind and lame.</l>
            <l>When that his Corpes were laid in the grave,</l>
            <l>his eldeſt ſonne poſſeſſe did the Farme,</l>
            <l>At the ſame rent as his Father before,</l>
            <l>he tooke great paines and thought no harme.</l>
            <l>By him there dwelt a Lawyer falſe,</l>
            <l>that with his Farme was not content,</l>
            <l>But over the poore mans ſtill hangs his noſe,</l>
            <l>becauſe he did gather the Kings rent.</l>
            <l>This Farme layd by the Lawyers Land,</l>
            <l>which this vile kerne had a mind unto,</l>
            <l>The déele a good conſcience, had he in his bulke,</l>
            <l>that ſought this poore man for to undoe:</l>
            <l>He told him that he his Leaſe had forfite,</l>
            <l>and that he muſt there no longer abide.</l>
            <l>The King by ſuch lownes hath mickle wrong done,</l>
            <l>and for you the world is broad and wide.</l>
            <l>The poore man prayed him for to ceaſe,</l>
            <l>and content himſelfe, if he would be willing,</l>
            <l>And picke no vantage in my Leaſe,</l>
            <l>and I ſhall give thée forty ſhilling.</l>
            <l>Its neither forty ſhillings nor forty pound,</l>
            <l>Iſe warrant thée ſo, can agrée thée and me,</l>
            <l>Vnleſſe thou yéeld me thy Farme ſo round,</l>
            <l>and ſtand unto my curteſie.</l>
            <l>The poore man ſaid he might not doe ſa,</l>

            <l>The Lawyer would not be ſo content,</l>
            <l>but further i'th matter he meanes to ſmell:</l>
            <l>The neighbors bad the poore man provide his rent,</l>
            <l>and make a ſubmiſſion to the King him ſell.</l>
            <l>This poore man now was in a great ſtond,</l>
            <l>his ſenſes they were almoſt wood:</l>
            <l>I thinke if a had not tooke grace in's minde,</l>
            <l>that he would never againe béene good:</l>
            <l>His head was troubled in ſuch a bad plight,</l>
            <l>as though his eyes were apple grey:</l>
            <l>And if good learning he had not tooke,</l>
            <l>he wod a caſt himſelfe away.</l>
            <l>A doughty heart he then did take,</l>
            <l>and of his mother did bleſſing crave,</l>
            <l>Taking farewell of his Wife and Bearnes,</l>
            <l>it earnd his heart them thus to leave;</l>
            <l>Thus parting with the teares in his eyne,</l>
            <l>his bob-taild dog he out did call:</l>
            <l>Thou ſalt gang with me to the King,</l>
            <l>and ſo he tooke his leave of them all.</l>
            <l>He had a humble Staffe on his backe,</l>
            <l>a Ierkin I wat that was of gray,</l>
            <l>With a good blue Bonnet he thought it no lacke.</l>
            <l>to the King he is ganging as faſt as he may.</l>
            <l>He had not gone a mile out o'th Toone,</l>
            <l>but one of his neighbours he did eſpy:</l>
            <l>

            <l>at home I had rather ſpent a crowne.</l>
            <l>Thus paſt he alang many a weary mile,</l>
            <l>in raine and wet, and in foule mire;</l>
            <l>That ere he came to lig in his bed,</l>

            <l>Hard they did fare their charges to ſave,</l>
            <l>but alaſſe, hungry ſtomackes outcryes for meate,</l>
            <l>And many a ſup of cold water they dranke,</l>
            <l>when in the lang way they had nought to eate,</l>
            <l>Full lile we knew his hard griefe of mind,</l>
            <l>and how he did long London to ken:</l>
            <l>But yet he thought he ſhould finde it at laſt,</l>

            <l>Thus with a low curtſie of them he tooke leave,</l>
            <l>thinking from the Court for to take his way:</l>
            <l>But ſome of the Gentlemen then of the Kings,</l>
            <l>would néeds invite him at dinner to ſtay.</l>
            <l>A little intreate did ſoone ſerve his turne,</l>
            <l>a thought himſel as good a man as them all,</l>
            <l>But where (quoth he) fall I have this ſame feaſt</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:20591:11"/>then ſtraight way they uſhered him into the hall,</l>
            <l>Such ſtore of Chéere on the boord there was plaſt,</l>
            <l>that made the Countryman much for to muſe.</l>
            <l>Quoth he, I doe thinke you are all crauty knaves,</l>
            <l>that ſuch a ſervice you will not refuſe;</l>

            <l>I thinke in the world ſuch feaſts there is none.</l>
            <l>When he had well dind and filled his panch,</l>
            <l>then to the Wineceller they had him ſtraight way,</l>
            <l>Where they with good Claret, &amp; brave old Canary,</l>
            <l>they with a Foxe taile him ſoundly did pay;</l>
            <l>So hard they did ply him with theſe ſtrong wines,</l>
            <l>that he did wrong the long ſeames of his hoſe,</l>
            <l>That two men were fayne to leade him up ſtayres,</l>
            <l>ſo making indentures, away then he goes.</l>
            <l>The poore man got home next Sunday,</l>
            <l>the Lawyer ſoone him did eſpy:</l>
            <l>Oh ſir, you have béene a ſtranger long,</l>
            <l>I thinke from me you have kept you by.</l>
            <l>It was for you indéed, ſayd the poore man,</l>
            <l>the matter to the King, as I have tell,</l>
            <l>I did as neighbours put it in my head,</l>

            <l>could not neighbors and friends agrée thée and me?</l>

               </gap>
            </l>
            <l>but if the Kings words be true to me,</l>
            <l>When you have read and perus'd it over,</l>
            <l>I hope youl leave and let me be.</l>
            <l>He has gin me another, but I know what tis,</l>

            <l>Pray you that are learned this letter reade.</l>
            <l>which preſently made them all agaſt.</l>
            <l>Then they did reade this letter plaine,</l>
            <l>the Lawyer muſt pay him a hundred pound,</l>
            <l>You ſée the Kings letter the poore man did ſay,</l>
            <l>and unto a poſt he fall ſtraight way be bound;</l>
            <l>Then unto a poſt they tyde him faſt,</l>
            <l>and all men did rate him in cruell ſort,</l>
            <l>The Lads and the Laſſes, and all in the towne,</l>
            <l>at him had great glée paſtime and ſport,</l>
            <l>Ile pay it, Ile pay it, the Lawyer ſaid,</l>
            <l>the attachment I ſée is good and fayre,</l>
            <l>Thou muſt néeds ſomething credit me,</l>
            <l>till I goe home and fetch ſome meare.</l>
            <l>Credit, nay that's it the King forbad,</l>
            <l>he bad if I got thée, I ſhould thée ſtay.</l>
            <l>The Lawyer payd him an hundred pound,</l>
            <l>in ready money, ere he went away.</l>
            <l>Would every Lawyer were ſerved thus,</l>

            <l>And thus I end my merry Tale,</l>
            <l>which ſhewes the plaine mans ſimpleneſſe,</l>
            <l>And the Kings great mercy in righting his wrongs,</l>
